This is [gitblanc's](https://github.com/gitblanc/) personal cybersecurity notes documentation webpage. Take into account that all the information contained here is for cyber-education and non-profit too. Thus, I'm not responsible for what is done with this information.

Keep in mind that if you have a web antivirus some of the notes might not be displayed or could be blocked due to this notes contain real viruses (but just for educational purposes and inoffensive).

I'll also upload some writeups of machines that I consider brainfuck for me.

Give me an ⭐️ in the Github repository if you like the content.
