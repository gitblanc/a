## Banner grabbing

```shell
curl -I inlanefreight.com

[redacted]
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:07:44 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Location: https://inlanefreight.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```

The output includesthe server banner, revealing the web server software and version number. In this case, we see that `inlanefreight.com` is running on `Apache/2.4.41`, specifically the `Ubuntu` version. This information is our first clue, hinting at the underlying technology stack. It's also trying to redirect to `https://inlanefreight.com/` so grab those banners too:

```shell
curl -I https://inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:12:12 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
X-Redirect-By: WordPress
Location: https://www.inlanefreight.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

We now get a really interesting header, the server is trying to redirect us again, but this time we see that it's `WordPress` that is doing the redirection to `https://www.inlanefreight.com/`:

```shell
curl -I https://www.inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:12:26 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/7>; rel="alternate"; type="application/json"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/>; rel=shortlink
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

A few more interesting headers, including an interesting path that contains `wp-json`. The `wp-` prefix is common to WordPress.
