- In this note there are multiple IDEs and tools to perform reversing

## Analyzing functions

- Sometimes you can find flags inside a function in plain text just by observing the **Decompiler** (open in `Window >> Decompiler`):

- If you find a lot of variables predefined on a function as follows:

![](Pasted%20image%2020240418210159.png)

- You can see that the first one is a `char` whereas the last one is a `pointer`. If we look at the dis-assembler section, we can get an idea about how these variables are added to the stack. We can clearly see a reverse order.

- The last char pointer which is **local_8** is the first one added to the stack as follows.
- We can see that each variable is assigned a value as follows. The first char variable which is **local_2c** is assigned to ‘**F**’ and all the undefined variables are assigned hex values.

- So now, we know that ==these hex values should be ASCII characters because each value is exactly one byte==.
- If you remember, we found that the last variable defined which is local_8, is a character pointer. Now, it is assigned to be a **hash of the string** starting at the memory address of the variable **char local_2c**, as follows.

- This means that it will hash the entire string from **bottom of the stack** to **top**. Thus, we need to **convert** each hex character assigned for the variables after **local_2c** into ASCII characters in order to obtain the string that is being hashed.
- You can use [hex-to-ascii converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html) for this purpose. You will be given the flag in ASCII.

---

- As you can see, there are some external functions called such as **FindResourceA()** and **LoadStringsA()**. When we look at the assembly code, we can come across that FindResourceA() is from the Kernel32 Library and LoadStringsA() is from User32 Library.

- What LoadStringsA() does is that it loads the string from its reference and stores at the variable **local_4a4.** So, let us find the reference.
- As shown in the above entry function, we know that **0x110** hex value parameter is the identifier for the string in LoadStringsA() function call.
- Hex 0x110 = Decimal **272**
- Open **Defined Strings** from Ghidra ribbon (Window >> Defined Strings). Scroll down and you will come across a FLAG table which contains many flags.

![](Pasted%20image%2020240418211141.png)

- Take a look at the equivalent code on dis-assembler and you will find-out the **string-ID** at the far right corner in decimal. So, scroll down until you find the string-ID 272.

## Using gdb when finding strcmp() function

```c
gdb file

(gdb) info functions

0x00000000004004b0  _init
0x00000000004004e0  puts@plt
0x00000000004004f0  __stack_chk_fail@plt

0x0000000000400716  main
0x0000000000400760  __libc_csu_init
0x00000000004007d0  __libc_csu_fini
0x00000000004007d4  _fini
```

- We are interested in the `strcmp@plt` function
- Set a breakpoint at the memory address of this function and run the binary in gdb with some test input:

```c
(gdb) b *0x0000000000400520

(gdb) run test
```

- The binary is executed until it hits the breakpoint as seen in the image above. Next, I can view the current state of the registers with gdb:

```c
(gdb) info registers

```

- Looking at the output above I can see the names of the registers, the registers value in hexadecimal format and the registers value in the format gdb thinks most appropriate (hex for pointers, decimal for the others). I can see that the general purpose registers rax and rdx have memory address values. I can use gdb to print the strings at these addresses:

```c
(gdb) x/s 0x7fffffffdd50
```
