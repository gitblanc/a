title: vHosts vs Subdomains ðŸ’¿
---
The key difference between VHosts and sub-domains is that a VHost is basically a 'sub-domain' served on the same server and has the same IP, such that a single IP could be serving two or more different websites.

`VHosts may or may not have public DNS records.`

In many cases, many websites would actually have sub-domains that are not public and will not publish them in public DNS records, and hence if we visit them in a browser, we would fail to connect, as the public DNS would not know their IP. Once again, if we use theÂ `sub-domain fuzzing`, we would only be able to identify public sub-domains but will not identify any sub-domains that are not public.

This is where we utilizeÂ `VHosts Fuzzing`Â on an IP we already have. We will run a scan and test for scans on the same IP, and then we will be able to identify both public and non-public sub-domains and VHosts.
