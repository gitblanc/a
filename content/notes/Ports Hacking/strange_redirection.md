From here, search forÂ `network.security.ports.banned.override`. In some versions of Firefox this might show nothing (in which case right-click anywhere on the page, chooseÂ `newÂ ->Â String`Â and use the search query as the preference name) â€” in others it will show the same as for me:

Whether youâ€™ve had to create a new entry or not, add or change the "Value" field to beÂ `22`:

You can now go back to the webpage and click reload. It should now load properly:
