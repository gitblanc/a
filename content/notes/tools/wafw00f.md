`Web Application Firewalls` (`WAFs`) are security solutions designed to protect web applications from various attacks. Before proceeding with further fingerprinting, it's crucial to determine if `inlanefreight.com` employs a WAF, as it could interfere with our probes or potentially block our requests.

To detect the presence of a WAF, we'll use the `wafw00f` tool.

```shell
wafw00f inlanefreight.com

                ______
               /      \
              (  W00f! )
               \  ____/
               ,,    __            404 Hack Not Found
           |`-.__   / /                      __     __
           /"  _/  /_/                       \ \   / /

    \\/`   \ |                                 / _ \
    `\    /_\\_              502 Bad Gateway  / / \ \  500 Internal Error

[*] Checking https://inlanefreight.com
[+] The site https://inlanefreight.com is behind Wordfence (Defiant) WAF.
[~] Number of requests: 2
```

The `wafw00f` scan on `inlanefreight.com` reveals that the website is protected by the `Wordfence Web Application Firewall` (`WAF`), developed by Defiant.

This means the site has an additional security layer that could block or filter our reconnaissance attempts. In a real-world scenario, it would be crucial to keep this in mind as you proceed with further investigation, as you might need to adapt techniques to bypass or evade the WAF's detection mechanisms.
