`Nikto`¬†is a powerful open-source web server scanner. In addition to its primary function as a vulnerability assessment tool,¬†`Nikto's`¬†fingerprinting capabilities provide insights into a website's technology stack.

## Basic scan

To scan¬†`inlanefreight.com`¬†using¬†`Nikto`, only running the fingerprinting modules, execute the following command:

```shell
nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
```

- The¬†`-Tuning b`¬†flag tells¬†`Nikto`¬†to only run the Software Identification modules.

`Nikto`¬†will then initiate a series of tests, attempting to identify outdated software, insecure files or configurations, and other potential security risks.

```shell
nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
