## Installation 

Before we begin, ensure you have Scrapy installed on your system. If you don't, you can easily install it using pip, the Python package installer:

```shell
pip3 install scrapy
```

First, run this command in your terminal to download the custom scrapy spider,Â `ReconSpider`, and extract it to the current working directory.

```shell
wget -O ReconSpider.zip https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/144/ReconSpider.v1.2.zip
unzip ReconSpider.zip 
```

## Basic command

```shell
python3 ReconSpider.py http://DOMAIN.com
```

### results.json

After runningÂ `ReconSpider.py`, the data will be saved in a JSON file,Â `results.json`. This file can be explored using any text editor. Below is the structure of the JSON file produced:

```json
{
    "emails": [
        "lily.floid@inlanefreight.com",
        "cvs@inlanefreight.com",
        ...
    ],

    "videos": [],
    "audio": [],
    "comments": [
        "<!-- #masthead -->",
